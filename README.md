# Qbserve Blocker

I was unable to find an app that blocks apps based on time-usage. This is an attempt to see what I can do on my own.

Notes in: https://www.notion.so/avery2/QbserveBlocker-883a2b8652eb45b4a0d0b07477871d93.

Gave up once I found a suitable solution using Freedom to schedule blocks on certain applications. I still want a time-based block as well, but this was good enough to the end project.

Future work would use:
 - [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/)'s scheduled exports to track time usage
 - [Freedom](https://freedom.to/)'s ability to block apps (using Selenium or Beautiful Soup to make it automatic)
 - Some system of scripts and mac automator to run the script periodically
