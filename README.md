# QbserveBlocker

I was unable to find an app that blocks apps based on time-usage. This is an attempt to see what I can do on my own.

Gave up once I found a suitable solution using Freedom to schedule blocks on certain applications. I still want a time-based block as well, but this was good enough to the end project.
